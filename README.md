# toimistobotti
The one and only, the legend, the disruptor, the all-seeing eye, the master, the bot.

This is a simple Slack bot that monitors for MQTT events for door and PIR sensors and sends video / image files from kerberos.io when something is going on.  
It is unlikely you'll have the exact same hardware and setup for this, so this project is probably not for you. But it may serve as an inspiration for someone.
